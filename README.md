# Chat-GPT-Challenges
Coding challenges generated by Chat-GPT.

Inside the `src` directory, it will contain three categories: beginner, intermediate, and difficult. Each challenge will also have a code-language Chat-GPT had set as a guideline. This is going to serve as practice for me to begin to understand other languages.

## Beginner Challenges
Languages: Python, JavaScript, Ruby.
1. FizzBuzz: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
2. Count the Vowels: Write a function that takes a string and returns the number of vowels in the string.
3. Reverse a String: Write a function that takes a string and returns the reverse of that string.

## Intermediate Challenges
Languages: Java, C++, C#
1. Anagram Checker: Write a function that takes two strings and returns True if the strings are anagrams of each other and False otherwise.
2. Binary Search: Write a function that takes a sorted list of numbers and a target number and returns the index of the target number in the list (or -1 if the target is not in the list) using binary search.
3. Merge Sort: Write a function that implements the merge sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers.

## Difficult
Languages: Rust, Haskell, Assembly
1. Sudoku Solver: Write a function that takes a partially filled-in Sudoku grid and fills in the missing squares. The input grid will be represented as a list of lists, where each sublist represents a row in the grid and the numbers are represented as integers (with 0 representing a missing square). The output should also be a list of lists with the completed Sudoku grid.
